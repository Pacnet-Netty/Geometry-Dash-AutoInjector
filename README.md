# GeometryDash-Hack-AutoInjector
This is a DLL Autoinjector for Geometry Dash. It can be configured to inject any dll in the same directory as the EXE by editing dll.txt.

By default, it comes with mgostIH's refresh rate bypass hack (Unlocker.dll) and is configured by default to inject Unlocker.dll.

See the Releases section to download it. To use it, just extract all the files in the zip to a folder, be logged into Steam, and run the exe. 

You must have a Steam copy of Geometry Dash and be logged into Steam to use this

Modify the Sleep() delays and recompile the program if your game opens too slowly and the injector tries to inject before the game has finished loading.
I might make the delays configurable later
